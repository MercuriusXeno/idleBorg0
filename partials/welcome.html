                Data will start to accumulate. Data is what you spend to hack more devices, as well as do research.
                <br/>
                You can only hold as much data as your total accumulated devices' storage allows.

                Device hacks take time. When you hack one or more devices, you'll get one device per tick until the hack ends.

                Every 25 devices of a tier nets you a 100% boost to data production. Hitting these hard points will help you progress faster.

                Once the Science tab (<i class="ion ion-beaker fg-cyan"></i>) is revealed, you can spend data to unlock new abilities.
